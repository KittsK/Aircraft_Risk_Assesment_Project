A business firm is interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprise
They want to know potential risks of aircrafts and I am charged with:

* Translate Findings to actionable insights that the head of aviation can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase

 ### Data Understanding and Analysis
