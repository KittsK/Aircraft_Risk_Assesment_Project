# Project 1
## AviationDataset
### Business Understanding
A business firm is interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprise
They want to know potential risks of aircrafts and I am charged with:

*  Determine which aircraft are lowest risk for the company to start this business endeavor
* Translate Findings to actionable insights that the head of aviation can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase

### Data Understanding and Analysis
#### Source of Data
This data has been sourced from the National Transportation Safety board from 1962-2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in US International Waters

#### Description of data 
I compiled a series of data through a thorough process of data cleaning and data wrangling as well as exploratory data analysis to get critical visualisations that would help me come up with formative conclusions as to how the company can make their business desicions
My key visualisation were :
* Most frequently involved Aircraft Makes in Incidents
* Heatmap of Aircraft Damage vs. Top Aircraft Models
* Heatmap of Injury Severity vs. Top Aircraft Models

#### Summary Conclusion of relevant findings
Data analysis and visuals enabled me to find concrete summaries and relevant insights that will help the business make the right decisions when choosing the best aircraft
The findings include :
* Brands like Cessna, Piper, Beech, Boeing and Bell dominate the skies. I took note on this and based my findings focusing on these makes
* From Cessna models like the 152 and 172 have had the most outstanding perfomance with 88% and 86% of incidents resulting in non-fatal injuries. This is a direct measure of occupant safety. Aircraft models from Cessna have again proven to be of value in asset management.The 152 and 172 with 82% and 86% respectively of total incidents resulting ‘substancial ’(i.e., repairable) damage. This indicates a very resilient airframe.
* We must explicitly avoid acquiring multi-engine models like the Beech 58 and the single engine jet/turbine Beech A36 for our initial operations, despite their performance capabilities. These models have a disproportionately high rate of fatal injuries and high aircraft damage
